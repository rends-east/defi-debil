# Optional: Demo Video & Presentation

Demo videos and slide decks are **mostly for presentation purposes**—pitches, finalist demos, or sharing with non-technical audiences. As a technical judge, I mainly **dive into the code and run the project myself**. What helps me most is a repo that’s easy to get running: clear setup steps, a working `docs/TECHNICAL.md`, and reproducible instructions. Making it easy to start is far more useful than a video or slides.

If you still want to link supporting material, you can use the fields below:

- **Demo video** — If you upload to YouTube (unlisted), you can paste the link here.

- **Slide deck** — If you have a text-based PDF, you can link it here.

> Video and slides are best when they support what’s already in the repo. For technical evaluation, I rely on the code and documentation first.
